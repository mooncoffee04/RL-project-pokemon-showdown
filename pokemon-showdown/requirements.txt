# Pokemon Showdown RL Agent - Requirements
# Compatible with Python 3.9.6 and macOS M4 chip
# Install with: pip install -r requirements.txt

# Core RL Framework
poke-env         # Pokemon Showdown environment wrapper
stable-baselines3  # RL algorithms (PPO, DQN)
gymnasium        # OpenAI Gym replacement (modern, required by poke-env)

# Deep Learning Backend (CPU optimized for M4)
torch              # PyTorch for M4 Mac
numpy             # Numerical computing

# Visualization and Analysis
matplotlib         # Plotting win rates and statistics
pandas             # Data analysis for battle logs
seaborn            # Enhanced visualizations
tensorboard        # Training progress monitoring

# Async/Network (for Pokemon Showdown communication)
aiohttp            # Async HTTP client
websockets         # WebSocket support for Showdown
requests           # HTTP requests

# Utilities
tqdm               # Progress bars for training
pyyaml             # Configuration files
tabulate           # Pretty tables for results

# Optional but recommended
jupyter            # For interactive analysis (optional)
ipython            # Better Python shell
